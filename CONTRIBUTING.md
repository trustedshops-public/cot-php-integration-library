First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Community of Trust PHP Integration Library. It's people like you that make the open-source community such a fantastic place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make will benefit everybody else and are greatly appreciated.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways you can contribute to this project, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code which can be incorporated into the library itself.

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

- **Use the GitHub Issues page** - Check if the issue has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- **Provide detailed report** - Include detailed information about how to reproduce the issue. If possible, provide a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!
